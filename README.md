## üì¶ Building and Installing the SiML Library

SiML uses **CMake** as its build system and supports out-of-source builds with **Ninja** or other CMake-supported generators.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version **3.28** or higher)
- [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) build system *(or another CMake-supported generator)*
- A **C++17** compatible compiler (e.g., GCC 9+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)

### üõ†Ô∏è Build and Install Instructions
**Configure the Project**

From the root of the project, generate build files in a separate `build/` directory:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build/ -G Ninja
```
Optionally if you want to specify the install path:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build/ -G Ninja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install
```
Build the project:
```bash
cmake --build build/
```
After a successful build, install the headers, library, and CMake configuration files:
```bash
cmake --install build/
```
---

### üß™ Build Example
Install locally in a subdirectory called `install/`:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build/ -G Ninja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./install
cmake --build build/
cmake --install build/
```
This will place all installed files inside the install/ directory relative to your current folder.
